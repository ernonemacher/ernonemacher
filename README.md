## Eduardo Nonemacher

I am a mobile software engineer currently graduating in Software Engineering at UTFPR (Federal University of Technology - Paran√°) in Brazil. I had the opportunity to spend a year in Germany at THI (Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt) where I studied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. With 3 years of professional experience in Flutter, I specialize in developing cross-platform mobile applications.

Even though my main focus is mobile development, I am a Full Stack developer with knowledge and professional experience with other technologies. I am a problem solver, languages and frameworks are just tools to build great experiences.

I am enthusiastic about connecting with people in the mobile software engineering area, whether to discuss potential collaborations or explore exciting opportunities within the industry.
